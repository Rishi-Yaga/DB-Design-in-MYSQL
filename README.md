## 🚀 Project Highlight

- The organization required a structured and scalable database system to manage transactional and customer data while reducing redundancy and improving query performance.  
- Design and implement a normalized relational database schema in MySQL ensuring data integrity and optimized performance.  
- Conducted requirement analysis, designed ER diagrams, implemented normalized tables (up to 3NF), defined primary/foreign keys and constraints, created indexes for performance optimization, and wrote complex SQL queries (joins, subqueries, aggregations) for reporting.
